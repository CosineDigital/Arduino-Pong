![gameplay](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CosineDigital/Arduino-Pong/master/static/gameplay.png)

## Features
- Support for 2 players
- Easy-to-use configuration file to customize gameplay
- Fast and controlled Arduino-to-computer communication
- Efficient Arduino code - only sends data when required

## Notes
- Code for the arduino only can be found [here](https://github.com/CosineDigital/Arduino-Pong/blob/master/src/arduino/firmware/firmware.ino).

## Circuit diagram
Below is a circuit diagram that is used for the Arduino Uno controller. A standard usb cable is used to connect the Arduino to the computer. All resistors are 10k ohms.
